MCl, or Mantle Cell Lymphoma, is a type of cancer only existant in rare circumstances. It was introduced to AVBotz, California by a diseased Varun Iyer. It usually develops one week before an important event. MCL is contagious when someone dies with it and particularly hurts victims because people rationalize "It's done" or "The angle function works." However, such statements are misleading, since this particular form of cancer has a reputation for finding itself to annoy, or even kill members from stress afterwards. Luckily, this disease is treatable. Dr Yang, M.D., from Pleasanton, California, has used risky experimental procedures to cure the cancer, and developed a solution that goes into the heart of MCL and fixes its underlying "angle function," rendering it harmless. Unfortunately, this was done too late, and the first victim, Varun Iyer, passed away, causing a chain reaction that harmed the community of AVBotz.
